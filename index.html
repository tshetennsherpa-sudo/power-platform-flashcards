        importance: "Enhances operational efficiency by automating administrative tasks and provides granular insights into platform components."
      },
      {
        term: "Troubleshooting Methodology (Power Platform)",
        definition: "A systematic approach to diagnosing issues, involving reviewing analytics/tools in the Admin Center, checking for inefficient queries, excessive loops, connector throttling, or poorly designed data structures. It also includes checking flow run history, error logs, verifying connector authentication, and validating API limits.",
        importance: "Rapid troubleshooting minimizes downtime and boosts user trust, maintaining user productivity and preventing recurring issues through root cause analysis."
      },
      {
        term: "Capacity Management (Power Platform)",
        definition: "The process of monitoring Dataverse database, file, and log capacity in the Admin Center, assigning appropriate licenses (e.g., Power Apps per App/Per User), and using capacity add-ons for scaling Dataverse storage and features.",
        importance: "Prevents service disruptions, controls costs, and ensures optimal user experience across the organization. Mismanaged licensing can lead to unexpected costs."
      },
      {
        term: "Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Integration",
        definition: "Integrating Power Platform with Azure AD to implement conditional access policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC). It's used for mapping AD groups to environment access and for comprehensive role management.",
        importance: "Crucial for robust security, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining user trust within the platform."
      },
